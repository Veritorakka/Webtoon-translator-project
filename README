# Webtoon Translator Project

## Project Overview
The **Webtoon Translator Project** is designed to detect speech bubbles in webtoon images using a trained YOLOv5 model and extract text from the speech bubbles using Tesseract OCR. The extracted text can then be translated using Marian-MT, a machine translation model. The project is capable of processing text in Chinese, Korean, and Japanese.

## Features
- **Speech Bubble Detection**: Uses a trained YOLOv5 model (`Bubbledect.pt`) to detect speech bubbles in webtoon images.
- **Text Extraction**: Extracts text from the detected speech bubbles using Tesseract OCR, with support for Chinese, Korean, and Japanese languages.
- **Machine Translation**: Translates the extracted text using Marian-MT for seamless language translation.

## Requirements
- **CUDA 11.0+** (if using GPU)
- **Python 3.8+**
- **Docker**

The required Python libraries are specified in the `requirements.txt` file:
